Have a black and white photo/image needing a tint? I got you covered!

This is just to show a simple tint with hue-rotate on the color wheel from sepia to replicate an existing tint, in this case sand color. You can't rotate greyscale due to the lack of color information so you convert to CSS sepia(100%) first for color information then rotate color from there. Hue-rotate confuses a lot of people because it's kind of confusing. Basically look at a color wheel.
