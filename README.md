Have a black and white photo/image needing a tint? I got you covered!

This is just to show a simple tint with hue-rotate on the color wheel from sepia to replicate an existing tint, in this case sand color. You can't rotate greyscale due to the lack of color information so you convert to sepia first for color information then roate color from there.
